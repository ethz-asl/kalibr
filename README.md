## Introduction
Kalibr is a toolbox that solves the following calibration problems:

1. **Multiple camera calibration**: 
    intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of a camera-systems with non-globally shared overlapping fields of view
1. **Visual-inertial calibration calibration (camera-IMU)**:
    spatial and temporal calibration of an IMU w.r.t a camera-system
1. **Rolling Shutter Camera calibration**:
    full intrinsic calibration (projection, distortion and shutter parameters) of rolling shutter cameras


**Please find more information on the [wiki pages](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki) of this repository.**

**For questions or comments, please open an issue on Github.**
