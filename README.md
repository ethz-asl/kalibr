## Introduction
Kalibr is a toolbox that solves the following calibration problems:

1. **Multi-Camera Calibration**: Intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of a camera-systems with non-globally shared overlapping fields of view with support for a wide range of [camera models](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/supported-models).
1. **Visual-Inertial Calibration (CAM-IMU)**: Spatial and temporal calibration of an IMU w.r.t a camera-system along with IMU intrinsic parameters
1. **Multi-Inertial Calibration (IMU-IMU)**: Spatial and temporal calibration of an IMU w.r.t a base inertial sensor along with IMU intrinsic parameters (requires 1-aiding camera sensor).
1. **Rolling Shutter Camera Calibration**: Full intrinsic calibration (projection, distortion and shutter parameters) of rolling shutter cameras.

To install follow the [install wiki page](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki/installation) instructions for which you can either use Docker or install from source in a ROS workspace.
Please find more information on the [wiki pages](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki) of this repository.
For questions or comments, please open an issue on Github.

## Quick Docker run
You can run Kalibr from a prebuild image using Docker:
```bash
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/pwd  mandulaj/kalibr:20.04
```
For more see the Overview on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mandulaj/kalibr)

## News / Events

* **Nov 24, 2022** - Some new visualization of trajectory and IMU rate for the generated report along with fixed support for exporting poses to file (see PR [#578](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/pull/578),[#581](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/pull/581),[#582](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/pull/582))
* **May 3, 2022** - Support for Ubuntu 20.04 along with Docker scripts have been merged into master via PR [#515](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/pull/515). A large portion was upgrading to Python 3. A special thanks to all the contributors that made this possible. Additionally, contributed fixes for the different validation and visualization scripts have been merged.
* **Febuary 3, 2020** - Initial Ubuntu 18.04 support has been merged via PR [#241](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/pull/241). Additionally, support for inputting an initial guess for focal length can be provided from the cmd-line on failure to initialize them.
* **August 15, 2018** - Double sphere camera models have been contributed to the repository via PR [#210](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/pull/210). If you are interested you can refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08957) for a nice overview of the models in the repository.
* **August 25, 2016** - Rolling shutter camera calibration support was added as a feature via PR [#65](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/pull/65). The [paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2013/papers/Oth_Rolling_Shutter_Camera_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf) provides details for those interested.
* **May 18, 2016** - Support for multiple IMU-to-IMU spacial and IMU intrinsic calibration was released.
* **June 18, 2014** - Initial public release of the repository.
